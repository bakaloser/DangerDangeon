## Gameplay

The player's hero is represented at the bottom of the screen.
The player moves around the bottom area of the screen with arrows
and shoots at a centipede advancing from the top of the screen down through a field of pumpkins. 
Shooting any section of the centipede creates a pumpkin and makes
centipede shorter; If the head is shot, the section behind it becomes the next head.
The centipede starts at the top of the screen, traveling either left or right. When it hits a pumpkin or the edge of the screen, it drops one level and switches direction. 
The player can destroy pumpkins by shooting them, but each takes three shots to destroy.
Pumpkins placed randomly.
If the centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, player loses one life. When all lives is gone game over.
